    <div class=lifeinfo>Gustav Elijah Åhr (November 1, 1996 – November 15, 2017), known professionally as Lil Peep
        (often stylized as LiL PEEP), was an American rapper, singer, songwriter and model. Helping pioneer an emo
        revival style of rap and rock music, Lil Peep has been credited as the leading figure in emo music of the 2010s.

        Born in Allentown, Pennsylvania, and raised on Long Island, New York, Lil Peep started releasing music on
        SoundCloud in 2014, using the pseudonym Lil Peep because his mother had called him "Peep" since he was a child.
        He soon became popular on SoundCloud after releasing several mixtapes, including Hellboy (2016), and for his
        collaborations with Lil Tracy, leading him to gain a cult following. His debut album Come Over When You're
        Sober, Pt. 1 (2017) peaked at number 38 on the Billboard 200.
        Lil Peep earned his highest-charting single on the Billboard Hot 100 in October 2018 with "Falling Down",
        featuring XXXTentacion, which peaked at number 13. Lil Peep's second studio album Come Over When You're Sober,
        Pt. 2 (2018) debuted at number four on the Billboard 200, making it his first US top 10 album. The compilation
        album Everybody's Everything was released on the 2nd anniversary of his death.

        Lil Peep was a frequent user of drugs due to his mental health, including depression and bipolar disorder. He
        died on November 15, 2017, exactly two weeks after his 21st birthday. The Pima County Office of the Medical
        Examiner certified the cause of death to be an accidental overdose of fentanyl and Xanax.</div>
